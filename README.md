# Business Problem and Context
Fraudulent credit card transactions has always being a bane for e commerce companies as it negatively impact their brand image among consumers and in the long run drive customers away and increase churn. It is more pressing for e commerce companies to deal with this now as credit card disputes have continued to rise past their pandemic boom. (https://www.straitstimes.com/business/credit-card-disputes-keep-rising-at-visa-as-e-commerce-booms). Disputes are often expensive for both credit card companies and merchants to process and it would be in the interest of both if a potential fraudulent transaction is pre-empterd early so it doesn't happen.

Our company has only done some exploratory analysis on our transaction data and have a rough sense of potential indicators of fraud. However, this isn't sufficent because the analysis is still stuck in jupyter notebooks or powerpoint slides. It would be preferable if we have a ML application that can predict the likelihood of fraud for each transaction in real time. This will substantially help to reduce fradulent transactions and help stem losses in revenue due to these cases.
